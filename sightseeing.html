						<h2>San Francisco</h2>

						<img src="img/travel-sanfran.jpg" class="roundy-bit" />
					</section>
					<section class="col col-first span_6">

						<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a> is fairly easy to navigate as a tourist. In fact, if you go to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Union+Square,+San+Francisco,+CA,+United+States&amp;daddr=1705+Mariposa+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA,+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.776753,-122.398081&amp;spn=0.03928,0.077162&amp;sll=37.776042,-122.398554&amp;sspn=0.03928,0.077162&amp;geocode=FVqZQAId8zW0-Cm7QP3TjoCFgDG6tkyZtdlB_g%3BFa05QAIdok20-Ckzf9mqzH-PgDHien2rs6m5Vg&amp;oq=1705+Mariposa+Street&amp;dirflg=r&amp;ttype=now&amp;noexp=0&amp;noal=0&amp;sort=def&amp;mra=ltm&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;start=0">google maps</a> and search for directions click on the little bus icon - it will provide directions via public transit.</p>

						<p>I suggest picking up a guidebook and choosing a few of the tourist highlights. Some lovely walks can be found near <a href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/sf/coittower.htm">Coit Tower</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfcablecar.com/">Cable Car</a> journey from Union Square to Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf is thrilling, and once in Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf you can head to <a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/">Alcatraz</a> and take a tour, visit the new <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">exploratorium</a>, or simply enjoy fresh crab for lunch!</p>

						<p>I really like the view of the &ldquo;Painted Ladies&rdquo; from <a href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/sf/alamosquare.htm">Alamo Square</a>, and from there you can walk to the Haight/Ashbury district for shopping (Ronan&rsquo;s favourite <a href="http://www.amoeba.com/">records store</a> is located there) and wander on into <a href="http://www.golden-gate-park.com/">Golden Gate Park</a>, perhaps have tea at the Japanese Tea Gardens or see the buffalo roam.</p>

						<p><a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/connect/contact">Anchor Steam Brewery</a> is an independent brewery in San Francisco. The offer FREE daily tours, but you have to call and make a booking (and the tours fill up MONTHS ahead of time). I highly recommend booking a spot, afterwards you get to sample a few free beers.</p>

					</section>

					<section class="col span_6">

						<p><stromg>A few things off the beaten track...</stromg></p>

						<p><a href="http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/china-beach.html">China Beach</a> is a lovely spot to take photos with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background (if it&rsquo;s not too foggy).</p>
						<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_District,_San_Francisco">The Mission</a> district is SF is a great place for authentic Mexican food, second hand and boutique shopping, and getting to see a bit of authentic SF life. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/list/best-of-the-mission-san-francisco">Yelp</a> has a list of favourites (I can concur that Tartine is amazing) and the NY Times did a<a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/travel/14hours.html?_r=0">piece</a> on the best of the Mission as well. The mission is a great spot for bars and nightlife.</p>

						<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco">The Castro</a> is another delightful SF neighbourhood. This area is known for being the gay epicentre of the city (the former residence of Harvey Milk was in the Castro). You can take a <a href="http://www.cruisinthecastro.com/">walking tour</a>, which is meant to be a really informative and fun activity for anyone. Nightlife in the Castro recommended for the adventurous, for the less adventurous I enjoy people-watching at <a href="http://www.squatandgobble.com/">Squat and Gobble</a>, a delightful opportunity to have eggs benedict and watch lovely mustachioed couples dining with their tiny tiny dogs.</p>

						<p>There are some great online sites for more ideas. See <a href="http://www.san-francisco-travel-secrets.com/san-francisco-things-to-do-off-the-beaten-path.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/California/San_Francisco-755471/Off_the_Beaten_Path-San_Francisco-TG-C-1.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60713-s403/San-Francisco:California:Off.The.Beaten.Path.html">here</a> to get started (some day trip ideas there too)!</p>

						<h2>The East Bay</h2>

						<img src="img/travel-eastbay.jpg" class="roundy-bit" />
					</section>

					<section class="col col-first span_6">

						<p>The East Bay is an easy BART journey from San Francisco. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g32066-Activities-Berkeley_California.html#TtD">Here</a> is the trip advisor guide to attractions. You will get to check out Mills College and The Bancroft since you&rsquo;re (obviously) going to attend the wedding.</p>

						<p>So because my main interests include both eating and shopping, here are my tips for those who also enjoy these activities as well:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://www.fourthstreetshop.com/">Fourth Street</a> in Berkeley is fun for posh boutique shopping - really great gifts and clothes to be found. If you&rsquo;re a non-shopper being dragged along by a shopping-enthusiast take a walk to the <a href="http://www.yelp.ie/biz/east-bay-vivarium-berkeley">Vivarium</a>, a giant reptile store where you can browse. I am planning to take my nephew - it&rsquo;s seriously impressive.</li>

							<li>College Avenue is also a great place to stroll and shop, if you enjoy slightly less posh boutiques, gift shops and secondhand finds. There are some lovely places to eat as well. See the <a href="http://www.rockridgeshop.com/">Rockridge Guide</a>&nbsp;for some ideas. Personally <a href="http://www.yelp.ie/biz/cactus-taqueria-oakland">Cactus Taqueria</a> is my favourite place to order an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguas_frescas">aguas frescas</a> [...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section class="span_6 col">

						<ul>
							<li>...] <a href="http://www.zacharys.com/">Zachary&rsquo;s</a> is a well-known spot for excellent deep-dish pizza, <a href="http://www.tootsiesboutique.com/">Tootsie&rsquo;s Shoes</a> is where I worked in college (they do pedicures!) and <a href="http://www.yelp.ie/biz/jeremys-berkeley">Jeremy's</a> is the place for discounted designer clothes.</li>

							<li>If you&rsquo;re staying in Berkeley you&rsquo;re within walking distance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattuck_Avenue">Shattuck.</a>&nbsp;There is loads to buy and eat, without working up a sweat. I particularly enjoy <a href="http://cheeseboardcollective.coop/">Cheeseboard Pizza</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://saulsdeli.com/">Saul&rsquo;s Deli</a>, which are on the north end of Shattuck (often called the &lsquo;gourmet ghetto&rsquo;) near the famous <a href="http://www.chezpanisse.com/intro.php">Chez Panisse</a>. <a href="http://www.angelineskitchen.com/">Angelines</a> offers Cajun food, <a href="http://www.jupiterbeer.com/">Jupiter</a> is good for beer and pizza, <a href="http://www.lanoterestaurant.com/">La Note</a> is lovely for breakfast and <a href="http://sanfrancisco.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=sanfrancisco&amp;cdn=citiestowns&amp;tm=52&amp;f=00&amp;su=p554.23.342.ip_&amp;tt=3&amp;bt=0&amp;bts=0&amp;zu=http%3A//www.rickandanns.com/">Rick and Ann&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;is my parent&rsquo;s favourite place!</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Okay, and ladies, if you want a suggestions for where to get hair or nails done before the wedding just <a href="mailto:ameson@gmail.com">email me,</a>&nbsp;there are lots of good spots in the area, and lads if ye need similar treatments there is an excellent barber in the locale, and Californian&rsquo;s are pretty open-minded about the male-mani-pedi trend.</p>

						<h2>Day Trips - Short Hops</h2>

						<img src="img/travel-santacruz.jpg" class="roundy-bit" />
					</section>

					<section class="span_6 col col-first">

						<p>There is much to see a short distance from San Francisco.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm">Muir Woods</a> and the town of <a href="http://www.sausalito.org/">Sausalito</a>&nbsp;are a short trip away by car, and bus tours go from SF there. Additionally you can book a wine tour that will take you through these places and into Napa and Sonoma to taste some amazing Northern California wines. Here are the top three tour operators: <a href="http://www.extranomical.com/">Extranomical</a>, <a href="http://www.winecountrytourshuttle.com/">Wine Country Tour Shuttle</a> and the <a href="http://www.destination-store.com/tour/san+francisco/muirwoodswinecountry/">SanFrancisco.com tour.</a></li>

							<li>If you are renting a car do make a visit to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm">Point Reyes</a>&nbsp;and have a picnic lunch at <a href="http://www.marinfrenchcheese.com/">Marin French Cheese</a>. Sally and I used to do this drive every year, in hopes of seeing a humpback whale during theirmigration, and of course to check out the sea lions!</li>

						</ul>

					</section>

					<section class="col col-first span_6">

						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California">Santa Cruz</a>&nbsp;is an excellent place to visit in the summer. It has a beach-town vibe, and is surrounded by redwoods and wineries. The shopping in the town centre offers a good selection of boutiques and gifts, and the <a href="http://www.beachboardwalk.com/">boardwalk</a> is the place to go sample fried food, dip in the ocean, and ride the big dipper. You can also take a cheesy tour at the Mystery <a href="http://www.mysteryspot.com/">Spot.</a>&nbsp;</li>
						</ul>

					</section>

						<h2>Northern California</h2>

						<img src="img/travel-norcal.jpg" class="roundy-bit" />
					</section>

					<section class="span_6 col col-first">

						<p>Once you go beyond the Napa/Sonoma wine country you will find yourself in the redwoods! There are so many beautiful drives and hikes.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If you decide to continue the journey North, you are in for a treat. Northern California is stunning and the weather tends to be nice and cool, even in the summer months.</li>

							<li><a href="http://avenueofthegiants.net/">Avenue of the Giants</a> is a lovely drive - watch for deer. <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415">Prairie Creek</a>&nbsp;is home to herds of elk (though for those of you who are used to jogging past them in Phoenix Park, this might not be as impressive a point). Once you&rsquo;ve reached the national park head to <a href="https://www.google.ie/search?q=fern+canyon&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=olwZUZDsDoWZhQev7oHYBw&amp;ved=0CDYQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679">Fern Canyon</a> to see where some of Jurassic Park was filmed (of course for non-Jurassic Park fans, it&rsquo;s still stunning).</li>

						</ul>

					</section>

					<section class="span_6 col">

						<ul>
							<li>Some lovely towns to stay in include <a href="http://www.trinidadcalif.com/">Trinidad</a>, or Eureka where my mom was born (stay at <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32363-d73500-r35525768-Carter_House_Inns-Eureka_California.html">Carter House Inn</a>), and I&rsquo;ve heard <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g32465-Guerneville_Sonoma_County_California-Vacations.html">Guerneville</a>&nbsp;is good as well (though I haven&rsquo;t been in over a decade!)</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="intro"><em>Further afield...</em></p>

						<p>You may as well continue onto Oregon and Washington from here. Portland and Seattle are great cities to visit, and of course you could even head to Canada. <a href="http://www.tourismvictoria.com/">Victoria</a>&nbsp;is a delightfully quaint place, and Vancouver is a wonderful city. There are some opportunities to sea kayak off the coast or take a <a href="http://sanjuansafaris.com/">boat tour</a> and spot a pod of killer whales from the San Juan Islands.</p>

					</section>

					<section class="col col-first center span_12">

						<h2>Sourthern California</h2>

						<img src="img/travel-socal.jpg" class="roundy-bit" />
					</section>

					<section class="col col-first span_6">

						<p>Many of you are planning a trip down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1">Pacific Coast Highway</a>. Here are some things to stop and do along the way...</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Firstly there is Monterey. Their <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/">aquarium</a>&nbsp;is world-famous - I suggest going in the morning and mid-week to try and avoid the crowds. Go ahead and set yourself down and watch the sea otters. <a href="http://www.oldfishermansgrotto.com/">Grottos</a>&nbsp;is the place for dinner in Monterey. Sally recommends staying in <a href="http://www.visitasilomar.com/">Asilomar.</a>&nbsp;</li>

							<li>Big Sur is just a stone&rsquo;s-throw away. This national park is a real must-see if you&rsquo;re going south. A friend of mine recently stayed in a yurt in <a href="http://treebonesresort.com/">Treebones Resort</a> and had a blast. My parent&rsquo;s favour <a href="http://www.bigsurlodge.com/">Big Sur Lodge</a>. There are lots of other options for various price ranges - have a good search on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g240329-Big_Sur_California-Vacations.html">tripadvisor</a>&nbsp;and wherever you stay <em>BOOK EARLY</em>! &nbsp;You can go for walks or hikes all around Big Sur, <a href="https://www.google.ie/search?q=mcway+falls&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XmAZUZ_xIJOWhQfT3oDIBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEgQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679">McWay Falls</a> is a stunning view and pretty low-key hike. I&rsquo;ve heard positive things about <a href="http://www.bigsurbakery.com/">Big Sur Bakery</a> and the photo ops at <a href="https://www.google.ie/search?q=bixby+bridge&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5mAZUZHOKoXLhAeq_4DQAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679">Bixby Bridge</a>&nbsp;as well.</li>

							<li>Continue on just a little way and visit <a href="http://www.hearstcastle.org/">Hearst Castle</a>, former residence of William Randolph Hearst (rumoured to be the inspiration behind the film Citizen Kane). This is a fab tour, once again BOOK EARLY. The only downside is looking at the stunning swimming pools and not being allowed to jump in - no fear, stay in a themed-room at the nearby <a href="http://www.madonnainn.com/">Madonna Inn</a> and you can swim in theirs.</li>

						</ul>
					</section>

					<section class="col span_6">

						<ul>

							<li>You&rsquo;ll be very near Paso Robles and more wine country at this point, if you&rsquo;re hankering for the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/">Sideways</a>&nbsp;experience. Santa Barbara is a gorgeous beachside city along the way. From there you&rsquo;re only about an hour and a half from Los Angeles.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I know very little about the sites in LA. Here are my friend Katie&rsquo;s top picks:</p>

						<ol>
							<li><a href="http://www.getty.edu/museum/">The Getty Museum</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://santamonicapier.org/">Santa Monica Pier</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.venicebeach.com/">Venice Beach</a>&nbsp;(for people-watching from an outdoor bar)</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.abbotkinneyonline.com/">Abbot Kinney</a>&nbsp;(the main street) for shopping and eating</li>
							<li>And if you can (and you should) an outdoor film screening at the <a href="http://www.hollywoodforever.com/">Hollywood Forever Cemetary</a></li>
						</ol>

						<p>Also, if you are in the Los Angeles area my dad is always advocating <a href="http://www.originaltommys.com/">Tommy Burgers</a>. <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Outs</a>, found all over the state, are my personal favourites.</p>

						<p>Katie recommends going as far as San Diego or Palm Springs to see the sights. From <a href="http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/">Palm Springs</a>&nbsp;you can visit the famous <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National Park</a>, which has been highly recommended to me. If you do decide to venture this direction...</p>

					</section>
					<section class="col span_6">
						<p> I suggest some good sun-cream and perhaps a wide-brimmed hat, drink lots of water and stay somewhere with a pool. Mind your delicate Irish complexions! And of course there is <a href="http://www.lasvegas.com/">Las Vegas.</a>&nbsp;Something about what happens there...</p>
